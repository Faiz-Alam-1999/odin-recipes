    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide flat pasta noodles with various ingredients such as seasoned ground meat, tomato sauce, creamy b√©chamel sauce, and cheese. The layers are typically repeated several times to create a hearty and flavorful dish. It's then baked until the noodles are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly, resulting in a deliciously satisfying meal that's perfect for gatherings or cozy family dinners. Lasagna is known for its rich and comforting taste, making it a beloved favorite in many households around the world.
