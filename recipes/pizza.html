    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy but has become popular worldwide. It typically consists of a thin, round dough base topped with tomato sauce, cheese (usually mozzarella), and various toppings such as meats, vegetables, and herbs. The dough is often baked in a hot oven, resulting in a crispy crust. Pizza can be customized to suit individual tastes, ranging from classic combinations like pepperoni and mushrooms to more adventurous options like pineapple and ham. It's enjoyed as a quick meal, a party food, or a comfort food, offering a satisfying blend of flavors and textures.
